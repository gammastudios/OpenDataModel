> Crafting an open-source tool that bridges the gap between traditional data modeling (like star schemas and Data Vault) and modern data transformation workflows managed by dbt engineers, aiming to address a significant niche in the data community.

> The focus on not just enabling the creation and visualization of data models but also on facilitating the actual transformation and mapping of data from source to target adds a layer of practicality often missing in conventional modeling tools.

# OpenDataModel

An open-source data modelling tool

# Product Vision

An open-source tool designed to help the way data teams design, transform, and document their data ecosystems. 
This tool aims to seamlessly integrate the early stages of data modeling with the downstream processes of data transformation, ensuring a cohesive workflow from the conceptual design to the physical implementation of data structures in the data warehouse.

# Tagline: 

"Seamlessly bridging data modeling and transformation for the modern data stack."

# Key Features

- *Visual Data Modeling for Modern Data Warehouses:* Allows users to create and visualize data models suitable for various architectures, including star schema and Data Vault, directly catering to the needs of complex and scalable data warehouses.

- *Direct Integration with dbt:* Provides a seamless connection with dbt projects, enabling users to define transformations within the context of their data models. This integration allows for the automatic generation of dbt models from the designed schema, streamlining the development process.

- *Data Mapping and Lineage Visualization:* Offers sophisticated tools for defining and visualizing data mappings, showing how data flows from source systems through transformation processes to target structures. This feature supports data governance and impact analysis by making it clear how data is manipulated and used across the organization.

- *Collaboration and Version Control:* Facilitates teamwork through collaborative design features and integration with version control systems like Git. This ensures that data models and transformation logic are kept in sync and can evolve together over time.

- *Customizable Templates and Best Practices:* Comes equipped with templates for common data modeling patterns and architectures, as well as the ability to define custom templates. This helps in promoting best practices and consistency across projects.

- *Ancillary Tools for Data Quality and Documentation:* Includes additional features for documenting data models, generating data dictionaries, and establishing data quality rules. This aids in maintaining high data quality standards and provides clear documentation for all stakeholders.
